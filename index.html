<h3>Education</h3>
<p>I've done my 10th from <strong>Universal High School Thane</strong>. Then i thought i'll try prepare for engineering but soo i realize it's not my cup of tea but i still pusued it from <strong>FIITJEE</strong>. Seems cool but it was a headache. Then i gave my entrance exams, fucked em up a little too much, got into <strong>Symbiosis Institute of Technology</strong>. Later realise engineering is shit. I dont like it. Now i'm trying to learn a few things but nothing seems intersting. Lets see what happens</p>
